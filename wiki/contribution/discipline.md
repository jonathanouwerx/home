# discipline

To create a reliable product discipline is very important.

## for threefold this means

- we have our profile filled in [team](/wiki/team/team.md) (as complete as kristof did)
    - each user has a person page, mine is despiegk which has your details, coordinates, sshkey, ...
    - make sure you are linked in the overview in team.md
- in each person page: 
    - we link to our projects where we are involved in and is active at this stage
    - link to your assignments in the project(s) on github you are involved in (see [kristof](/wiki/team/despiegk.md))
        - e.g. https://github.com/orgs/freeflowuniverse/projects/3/views/8?filterQuery=-status%3A%22%E2%9C%85+Done%22+assignee%3Adespiegk (note how to add assignee)
        - this allows everyone to see immediately what you are working on
        - if you have more than one project, make sure you list them all
- on the projects in github where we are involved in
    - we have all remaining work with a deadline & remaining hours (if in an active column e.g. in_progress)
    - we have all issues/tasks we know of in the projects which are active (means in one of the active columns progress, ...)
- we take responsibility on our own stories & tasks/issues
    - you take responsibility: whatever you can’t do, you work with product owners/stakeholders and put it on next release, if you can’t get to them yet put in blocked column
    - we have all stories we own properly defined and linked with proper label type_story and linked in right project
    - we follow up on our stories we own and make sure that the issues linked to it are in the relevant project, specified, ...
    - we respect our deadlines, if we can't make it we escalate
- if we own a product we have our ownership well defined in [components list](wiki/components/components_overview.md) 
- collaboration is not taken lightly
    - we think before we do, we read before we run, we make sure we understand, if we don't we ask for help or clarifications
    - we are part of a company, when there are company meetings or meetings important for our work we are there, if not we have a good reason and will listen to the zoom
    - we work with our community and we are grateful for their contributions (forum, ...)
    - we finish and get to good enough, before we do the next, we use comments on github issues, we communicate where needed
    - i don't just do something because I am supposed to do something, rather than actually taking the time to process and do it properly, I realize if I do something half it has impact on people around me
