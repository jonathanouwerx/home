To create a reliable product discipline is very important.

## for threefold this means

- we have our profile filled in in [team](wiki/team/team.md) (as complete as kristof did)
- we link to our projects where we are involved in and is active at this stage
- for each project we have all remaining work with a deadline & remaining hours (if in an active column e.g. in_progress)
- we have all issues/tasks we know of in the projects which are active (means in one of the active columns progress, ...)
- we have all stories we own properly defined and linked with proper label type_story and linked in right project
- we take responsibility on our own stories & tasks/issues
    - we follow up on our stories we own and make sure that the issues linked to it are in the relevant project, specified, ...
    - we respect our deadlines, if we can't make it we escalate
- if we own a product we have our ownership well defined in [components list](wiki/components/components_overview.md)
