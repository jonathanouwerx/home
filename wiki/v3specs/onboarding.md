# Onboarding

>NOT USABLE YET

## Why

Today we do everything with TFConnect which is a nice solution but not so compatible with rest of blockchain world.

We're looking for ways how we can onboard using a std stellar and/or algorand wallet, lets start with algorand to prove the point.

## Ideas

- javascript library 
  - gives unified way to get to a private key for a specified blockchain (stellar, tfchain, algorand)
- how
  - use signing feature of the wallet functionality of stellar and/or algorand to create derivate which results in the required priv key
- remarks
  - allows us to use all supported features by these blockchains e.g. hardware keys

## process algorand

- get an algorand account with USDC (this is easy to do)


## algorand - stellar

- we create CHI on Algorand and Stellar with 25m CHI in a treasury account A
- 1 CHI corresponds with 2 TFT
- treasury account has 9 signing keys for creation of money & destruction
- treasury account has 9 signing keys forsame for sending
-
