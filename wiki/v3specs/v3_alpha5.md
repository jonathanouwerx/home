# ThreeFold Grid v3.0.0 Alpha - 5

Sprint overview for TFGrid v3.0.0 Alpha-5

## TFNode-Pilot v0.1.0

Pocket Network is a blockchain data platform built for applications that uses cost-efficient economics to coordinate and distribute data at scale, enabling seamless interactions between blockchains and applications.

In order to **deploy PoktNetwork to TF Terraform Grid Provider**, we need to reverse engineer the Pokt node pilot into Node pilot light. It is a similar to node-pilot but open-source and stripped down. the scripts are being written into this [repository.](https://github.com/threefoldtech/node-pilot-light)

## TFT Shop v1.1.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/it_as_energy_shop/projects/9

On the first initial release of TFT Shop v1.0.0, we have made it easier for users to buy TFT by trading their BTC on our official [TFT Shop website](https://gettft.com/gettft/).

On this v1.1.0 release, we aim to give the users another** option to buy TFT by using fiat currency**. This will be made possible by integrating [mercuryo.io](http://www.mercuryo.io/) (third-party) widget onto the shop. By buying TFT using TFT Shop you confirm that you read and agree to [ThreeFold’s terms and conditions](https://library.threefold.me/info/legal/#/legal__terms_conditions_gettft).


## TF RMB v0.2.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/rmb_go/projects/2

RMB (Reliable Message Bus) is an essential component of TFGrid v3. It enable clients (a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a designated service on the TFGrid) to talk directly to TFChain and ZOS,  and connects all TFGrid components without needing an intermediary tool. On this release we would like to **improve the performance of RMB, rewriting the codes from GoLang to Vlang, adding PGP support**, adding better documentations and many more.

## ZOS v3.1.0

### Performance Improvements
Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/projects/106

This new feature release of ZOS v3.1.0 includes a lot of improvements such as **improvements on performance issues** (disk and IO), grid events handling, and improvement on the current yggdrasil network by start and maintaining our public peers.

### ZOS Supoort Dedicated Nodes

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1156

To empower community-driven decentralization on the TFGrid, we would like to soon invite anyone to deploy their own solutions on the TFGrid. This is feasible to do by allowing any external developers to** deploy their own workloads on** **dedicated nodes** and provide the deployment documentation. By choosing to deploy on dedicated nodes, a user can reserve an entire node, then use it exclusively to deploy solutions for themselves or for other customers. Therefore on this release we would like to support dedicated nodes deployment, and apply the dedicated node contracts on TFChain and support mechanism both on ZOS and 's next release.


## TF Playground v3.0.0 Alpha-5
Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_weblets/projects/8

### New community and blockchain solutions
On the last release, we have added new deployable community solutions on TF Playground, such as Peertube, Funkwhale and Taiga, Mattermost as well as some developer tools like CapRover, Virtual Machine, Kubernetes and Owncloud.

On this release, we will add more **community and blockchain solutions** such as Discourse (forum), Presearch Node and Casperlabs validator node.

### UX Improvements: Simplified Solution Deployment Sizing
On this release we also aim to create **UX improvements on the existing TF Playground** website 1that could create a better experience for our users. One of them is by simplifying solution deployment processes by creating deployment sizing.

We would add **capacity sizing** for each deployment, such as: “small”, “medium” and “large”. Each size requires a different capacity amount. For example, an ‘S’ size for Funkwhale deployment, would need a different capacity amount to ‘S size for Peertube deployment.

## Uhuru v1.1 (beta)

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/twin_aydo/projects/4

### New Backend Changes

[Uhuru](www.uhuru.me) is a digital product on top of a the TFGrid that enhance collaboration with features such as chat, videocall, office tools, and file storage, all in one platform. You can visit [beta.uhuru.me](beta.uhuru.me) to try its latest beta release of v.1.0.0.

On this release, a big backend change is required to actually communicate using the [RMB (Remote Message Bus)](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rmb) and include the full stack on TFGrid. In this version we won't change anything functionally, but include the backend changes needed to be able to execute this.

To decentralize this entirely, we will search other addresses on the blockchain, through RMB. Included as a result of these major backend changes, there will be a lot of bug fixing and rewriting flows/code to work with the new backend.


## ThreeFold Wallet v3.0.0

Project: [https://github.com/threefoldtech/wallet-next/projects/2](https://github.com/threefoldtech/wallet-next/projects/1)

### Add (substrate-based) TFChain Wallet

TFGrid v3 is powered by substrate-based blockchain. A TFT is moveable from Stellar blockchain to TFChain through the use of a bridge.
ThreeFold Wallet needs to **add (substrate-based) TFChain Wallet in order to support the bridge transaction**. 

However, TFT is still the native currency on TFChain. As such, there is no need for an external service to transfer tokens on TFChain. A transaction fee is charged (currently 0.01 TFT) for every transaction/extrinsic call. 

## TF Farm Management Tool v1.2.0

### Adjust farm management for the latest TFChain upgrade

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/wallet-next/projects/5

On the last sprint, alpha-4 we released Farm Management Tool v1.0 and v1.1 which allows farmers to migrate their farms from v2 to v3 through the TF Connect application.

Recently a change was made within the codes of TFChain, thus broke the farm management function in the wallet. Therefore, on the v1.2.0 release, code changes needed to alson be done on **Farm Management Tool to adapt itself with TFChain changes**. This was done quickly in production.

## TFConnect App v3.5.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/threefold_connect/projects/7

### Generic Frontend and Backend Improvements
This new feature release of TFConnect App includes new features such as **enabling user to sign documents on the app** directly, and many other backend improvements.

### Planetary network v0.2.0 iOS

On last release, we have officially released Planetary Network v0.2.0 on TFConnect App - Android. On this release we are releasing** Planetary Network v0.2.0 on TFConnect App on iOS**. Planetary Network is your gateway to access ThreeFold’s p2p internet. Click here to read more about[ TF Planetary Network](https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__yggdrasil_client). 

### Integrate TFConnect SSO to TFPlay Solutions

We need to simplify peer-to-peer collaboration and how users interact with their TFPlay solutions. We would like to eliminate a complicated way of signing up to solutions (emails, username and password) by replacing it using **TFConnect app SSO login**. Therefore on this release, we are** creating SSO backend environments for the following TFPlay solutions**: Discourse. Mattermost, and Gitea that will allow users to sign in and start using the solutions with just few clicks.

## TFChain v1.2.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/projects/2

  ### ThreeFold DAO Pt. 2: Adjoint Validator-Council member request

From version 3.0 on, [ThreeFold Grid operates as a DAO](threefold:dao). On the last release of TFChain v1.0.0,  we have successfully implemented The first TF-DAO that allows farmers to request to become DAO council members. 

On this release we would like to implement **ThreeFold DAO Request part 2 where any farmer could request to become an adjoint validator-council member**: by running a a validator node, not only that they become a validator, they would also gain a seat as DAO council member that give them the right to vote for organizational changes.

### ThreeFold DAO Pt. 2: Enable Validator Application

On this release we would like to also implement ThreeFold DAO Request part 2 any farmer could **apply to become a validator **and register the validator application on-chain if they meet the validator requirements.

## TFGrid Client Proxy v1.2.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgridclient_proxy/issues/107

### Implement REST API

TFGrid Client Proxy contains list of farms, nodes and node details information on the TFGrid. On the next release of TFGrid Client Proxy, we would like to implement REST API:  a set of application integration protocols that follows the **REST- (REpresentational State Transfer)** architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. One of the key advantages of applying REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. This would be beneficial to **make the way we handle datas of farms and nodes on TFGrid more flexible and independent. 
**

## **‘Owncloud powered by ThreeFold’ Deployer Website v0.1.0**

Project: https://github.com/threefoldtech/www_owncloud/projects/1

ThreeFold has teamed up with Owncloud to provide a time-limited freemium experience of Owncloud product on the TFGrid as a SaaS product. 
Users would soon be able to** deploy their freemium TF Owncloud solution by signing up for an account on the new TF Owncloud deployer **website using their TFConnect SSO (ThreeFold ID).
