## Agenda

- Zos Image builds seems to work in containers just fine
- the plan for 3.8 will be more limited to (power management, capacity planning, ipfs and qsfs)
	- Jan already started power mgmt 
	- Capacity planning probably should be done on the chain?
- we really need to plan Grid monitoring
- booting nodes in another farm issue https://github.com/threefoldtech/test_feedback/issues/282
- tft unlock / migration services https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1265 (closed) 
- tft bridge prometheus https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain_tft_bridge/issues/66 ?
- testnet upgrade
- thirdparty billing https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/445
- use ADRs in repos e.g zos and tfchain  https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/446 
- algorand sizes too big to test on devnet https://howbigisalgorand.com/ -> develop against mainnet
