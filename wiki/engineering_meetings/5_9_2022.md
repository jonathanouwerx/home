## Agenda
 - Anyone can currently boot a node in any farm. This could potentially be bad for a farmer if the node is not as good as the other nodes in the farmer’s farm.
   Should we have farmers have to accept nodes into their farms?
 - Do we verify that the node and the farm are owned by the same person?
 - https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1258. L1 Validator discussion, been blocked for too long (rob will double check)
 - Zos Image build. Where are we at?
 - TPM usage for encryption @maxime needs to do some research
 -  L2 validators code is blocked on the wallet flow
 - https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1298 why are they accessing graphql instead of the gridproxy?
 - public ips deployment on devnet is resolved https://github.com/threefoldtech/test_feedback/issues/272, but do we have any guarantees it won’t happen again?
 - booting nodes in another farm issue https://github.com/threefoldtech/test_feedback/issues/282
 - tft unlock / migration services https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/1265 (rob to confirm is fixed)
 - QA are running their testsuites on QAnet
