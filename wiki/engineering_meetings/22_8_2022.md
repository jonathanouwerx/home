## Agenda

- Procedure for environment upgrades and API breakage
- Minting details is about to be ready
- TPM
- IPFS (Lee will work on the specs and listing the issues) 
- QSFS got moved to 3.8 
- The team also provided kds with a mechanism to invoke the grid client in the browser from a V process in the backend through websockets 
- FireSquid weblet seems to be working fine (dylan will be part of the validation)l
- Pricing calculator will be available in the dashboard 
- When we got the chance will do WalletConnect POC
- Spec for L2 validator application on Stellar is ready ( depends on something like WalletConnect) kds wants to review 
- Creating some tests to be able to create the INCA spec (need info)
- Creating the gold farming Policy on mainnet and linking all Green Edge farms (issue in minting because existing capacity - nodes are not getting this policy) This would require more work on tfchain https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/406
Linking green edge farm will result in multiple proposals, suggestion to create a text proposal and if that passes we can manually link green edge farms one by one (there is no concept of doing a batch call (multiple extrinsics) in 1 call) -> https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/402
- TFT pricing oracle on tfchain ( looks like TFT is not delisted on liquid yet but we better be prepared)
- Solution provider https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/issues/407
- Addition of IPs happening one by one now, if you want to add a range of IPs will require multiple extrinsics
