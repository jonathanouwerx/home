# 3Bot improvements for TFGrid 221

- developer story card [3bot deployer for 2.2.1](https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/issues/906)

## UI in 3bot deployer

- show the 3bots (all in 3 different tables)
- show the state of the 3bot: active (started), archived (stopped), expired (stopped &amp; deleted backups)
- show when they expire (done already for the started)
- actions starting from state
  - started
    - stop (means no longer running, backup still there)
    - destroy (stop &amp; delete backup)
    - go to the 3bot
  - stopped
    - start
      - ask secret
    - destroy (delete backup)
    - change size (change in the local DB) - \&gt; start wizard see (B)
    - change location (remove capacity pool from local DB) - \&gt; start wizard see (A)
  - expired ( stopped &amp; deleted backups)
    - start
      - ask secret

## step by step for start 3bot:

- ask name if not given from the UI overview
  - check name exists, if yes, ask name again
  - (A) choose where to host your 3bot
    - choose your region
      - next screen: ask Europe/Asia/MiddleEast
      - check there is capacity, find a node
      - tell the node which will be used and where and confirm there was enough capacity
      - ask for ok, if not ok restart choose location
    - choose a farm
      - check there is capacity, find a mode
      - tell the node which will be used and where
      - ask for ok, if not ok restart choose location
    - specific node
      - check if enough capacity
      - tell something about the node: its life since, capacity is X,Y ..., name...
      - ask for ok, if not ok restart choose location
  - (B) choose size
    - Silver 0.5 CRU 2 MRU
    - Gold 1 CRU 4 MRU
    - Platinum  2 CRU 8 MRU
    - remember in local DB
  - (C) create identity
    - tell user identity created
    - tell creation of capacity pool
    - tell user we funded the capacity pool with X TFT
    - tell user we created mgmt network and it succeeded
    - tell user that the funding of the 3bot needs to happen; 1 h
    - remember in local DB
      - user identity (name,id)
      - capacity pool (name,id)
      - mgmt network (name,id)
- if 3bot exists (has backup but not running) and capacity pool is empty
  - fund for 1h
  - tell user that the funding of the 3bot needs to happen < 1 h
- give your secret (secret used to deploy/restore)
  - not stored on central server

## when 3bot starts

- when UI starts for user
- if less than 1000 TFT
  - ask if user wants to add more tokens to 3bot wallet
  - if yes
    - ask for TFT
      - ask for TFT, min 400 TFT, max 20000 TFT

## 3bot resources monitoring

- check if there are any capacity pools with resources < 2 weeks,
 if yes add 2 weeks using money from local wallet
- if we are running out of TFT
  - start sending emails
- there is a flag auto top up of capacity pools
