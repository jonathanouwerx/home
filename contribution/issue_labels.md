# labels as used on issues

Please do not use any other labels

## priority based

- `priority_critical`: means it needs to fixed/implemented NOW, with a maximum of the day itself
    - If for any reason the developer feels this is unachievable, they must immediately escalate.
    - critical basically means, no-one goes home (sleeps), untill its fixed, only use this for things which are blocking to that point.
- `prority_major`: means it is very urgent. should be fixed/implemented with minimal time (usually up to 3 days, but should be 1-2 days normally max). 
    - If for any reason the developer feels this is unachievable, they must immediately escalate.
- anythin with no labels is 
    - or in swimlane to start, means we don't work on it this week
    - or in swimlane in progress, which means its finished this week
    - or in swimlane blocked, means to be resolved in 1-2 days
- `priority_minor`: put at back of sprint cycle

## type
